📊 StockPriceTracker
🧠 About the Project

StockPriceTracker is a Python-based machine learning project that analyzes, trains, and predicts stock prices using historical market data.
It combines data science, ML models, and visualization to help users understand market trends and make data-driven investment insights.

The project fetches historical stock prices, preprocesses the data, trains a predictive model (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM), and visualizes both actual and predicted prices in an interactive graph.

🚀 Features

📈 Fetches historical stock data (from Yahoo Finance or CSV)

🧹 Cleans and preprocesses datasets (handles missing values, normalizes data)

🤖 Trains ML models for price prediction

📊 Visualizes stock trends and model predictions

💾 Saves trained models for future predictions

🧩 User can choose stock symbols and visualize their price predictions

🧰 Technologies Used
Category	Tools & Libraries
Language	Python
Data Handling	pandas, numpy
Visualization	matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
Machine Learning	scikit-learn, tensorflow / keras
Data Source	yfinance, alpha_vantage
Environment	Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
⚙️ How It Works

Import / Fetch Data – Collect stock price data using APIs or CSV files.

Preprocess Data – Clean and normalize datasets for model training.

Split Data – Divide into training and testing sets.

Train Model – Apply a machine learning algorithm to learn from past data.

Predict Future Prices – Use the trained model to forecast stock prices.

Visualize Results – Compare actual vs. predicted prices using graphs.

🧪 Example Code Snippet
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch Data
data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2018-01-01", end="2024-12-31")

# Prepare Data
data['Prev Close'] = data['Close'].shift(1)
data = data.dropna()

# Features and Target
X = data[['Prev Close']]
y = data['Close']

# Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model Training
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
predicted = model.predict(X_test)

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(y_test.values, label='Actual Price')
plt.plot(predicted, label='Predicted Price', color='red')
plt.title('Stock Price Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
